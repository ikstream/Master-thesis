\chapter{Measurements}
\label{chap:mmeasurement}

To evaluate and debug the conTest framework, we conducted multiple measurements with the Minstrel algorithm. In this chapter we list the parameter we monitored during our measurements and show which limitations our test environment setup faces. In the last part of this chapter we describe the scenarios we would like to use for our measurements.\\

\section{Summary}

In this the section \ref{sec:measurement:parameter} we introduced the parameter for our measurements. While we are able to ... we can only measure ... . Section \ref{sec:measurement:limits} provides an overview of the limitations our data set faces. Finally we provide three channel condition scenarios. For this thesis we are going to concentrate on a scenario with improving and decreasing channel conditions.\\
In the next section we present our evaluation of the collected data from the setup introduced in \ref{sec:measurement:eval_setup}.\\
