In community-based software development projects for multi-platform systems, such as OpenWrt, Tasmota, etc., developers currently have very limited information about the platforms on which and on how many platforms their software is used. Such data could improve the software development process significantly. 
Therefore this thesis will discuss ...
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research suitable transmission technologies
    \item system anonymization
    \item System identification
    \item data collection
    \item data obfuscation
    \item data transmission
    \item frequency of transmission
    \item elimination of duplication
    \item reference implementation
    \item data collection disclaimer    
    \item user acceptance
    \item data evaluation
    \item first results
\end{itemize}
