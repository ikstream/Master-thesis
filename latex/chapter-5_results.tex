While the presented solution addresses the need for a privacy preserving, secure data collection tool, there are some points, that could not be addressed. 
Using the structure of DNS we were able to detach the clients IP from the data, which, in turn, is transported encrypted utilizing asynchronous encryption. 

In this chapter we provide information of our evaluation steps and discuss the results of our measurement setup described in the last chapter.\\

\section{Limitations of the collection}
\label{sec:measurement:robust}
%

    We looked into ways to validate the collected data. If development is based on on the data, adversaries might try to generate emulated devices. To counter the emulation, we only use physical devices with PCI addresses for the ID generation. This excludes Linux containers like docker without network card passthrough. The message buffer of the kernel is checked if the kernel is loaded in a virtual environment like KVM or Virtualbox. The client checks this, using the \textit{dmesg} application. 
    If a virtual environment is detected, the client stops, before transmitting any data.\\
    
    Another option to check for validity is to check the integrity of the source code. Therefore a hash or similar can be generated over the existing source code and transmitted to the server.
    If a cryptographic hash function is used, source code modification would show in the hash value transmitted.\\
    This, and other options can be leveraged with patching the source code. Especially in open source software it is easy to manipulate the software. The function that generates the hash of the source code could be pointed to intact source code, while the running code has been modified. While it is more complicated, the same is true for closed source software.
    Using a closed source implementation for data collection in an open source project might reduce users' trust in a project and make them stop using it.
    



- Ausschluss von docker, da nur virtuelle interfaces, oder interfaces reingereicht
- Multithreading
- Fake devices mit geänderter MAC adresse.
- server seitiges handling beim publishing
- data exfiltration alert-> komische strings im Netzwerk
- docker ausgeschlossen durch check ob pci interface
- virtuelle maschinen schwieriger, aber geprüft.
- number of available mac addresses -> 1 interface geräte ansprechen

Wenn Nutzer Konto notwendig um zu nutzen -> token vergabe

Sonst immer checks umgehbar, da Open Source. Used könnten software mit Änderungen selbst kompilieren/ändern.

Hashen des Codes zur Validierung das source code intakt serverseitig

Auch rekonstruierbar

Auch Übermittlung vendor ID von Mac nicht sicher, da Mac manipulierbar

Serial Generation, wenn Algorithmen bekannt, auch manipulierbar
