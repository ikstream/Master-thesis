\section{Limitations of the collection}
\label{sec:measurement:robust}
%

- Ausschluss von docker, da nur virtuelle interfaces, oder interfaces reingereicht
- Multithreading
- Fake devices mit geänderter MAC adresse.
- server seitiges handling beim publishing
- data exfiltration alert-> komische strings im Netzwerk
- docker ausgeschlossen durch check ob pci interface
- virtuelle maschinen schwieriger, aber geprüft.


Wenn Nutzer Konto notwendig um zu nutzen -> token vergabe

Sonst immer checks umgehbar, da Open Source. Used könnten software mit Änderungen selbst kompilieren/ändern.

Hashen des Codes zur Validierung das source code intakt serverseitig

Auch rekonstruierbar

Auch Übermittlung vendor ID von Mac nicht sicher, da Mac manipulierbar

Serial Generation, wenn Algorithmen bekannt, auch manipulierbar

User account. Creation/token Bezug erhöht den Aufwand

G: Data gathering instrument

Netzwerk Footprint. Viele clients gleichzeitig -> Datenverbrauch

\section{Summary}
As expected, the user systems are fully anonymized ... and several different devices reported to our servers
