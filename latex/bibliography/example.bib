In this study we will first review the conceptqualityof service, what it is and then we study the two most important efforts to provide QoS in the Internet:the Integrated Services and the Differentiated Services models. Both have their own application areaas the first provides more fine grained control to network resources as the later gives better scalability.},

One of the main reasons is the limitations in changing MAC parameters in current driver implementations. To this end, in this work, we developed a general cross-layer communication interface in the Linux kernel between the IEEE 802.11 PHY and MAC to enable per packet TPC. Based on this implementation, we realize an decentralized rate-power controller (Minstrel-Piano). Our initial evaluation shows that Minstrel-Piano is able to signiﬁcantly decrease the power levels while maintaining the same link performance. These results are encouraging for a better interference management and consequently, better resource allocation in WiFi networks.},

	abstract = {A substantial variety of control algorithms to adjust carrier sensing, transmission power, and transmission rate have been proposed for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in the recent literature. Their objectives range from maximizing throughput, spatial reuse, and fairness to minimizing interference and congestion within the network. However, only a few of these have been implemented and analysed in practice, often because accessing and changing the necessary parameters in the wireless hardware is too difﬁcult. Essentially, there is little understanding about the interactions of jointly adjusted transmission rate, power and carrier sense thresholds, and their impact on the aforementioned objectives. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on transmission rate, power and carrier sensing settings. We provide a detailed description of the common IEEE 802.11 radio hardware, especially in terms of carrier-sensing circuitry. We then present our results from our validation and initial measurement study, which demonstrate interactions between transmit power and rate under different carrier-sensing settings in a two link scenario. Our initial ﬁndings indicate there exists a limited number of ratepower combinations that achieve high performance in terms of either throughput and fairness both with and without carrier sensing. Furthermore, in the case of both strong and weak links exist in the network, turning carrier sensing off signiﬁcantly improves performance.},

Design of a rate selection mecha-nism is complicated by the variety of sources of packet lossin 802.11 networks, the difficulty of testing rate adaptation,and interaction with higher layer protocols (especially TCP).Minstrel is based solely on acknowledgement feedback. Con-sequently, estimates of future success at a given rate are basedonly on past success ratios at that rate. Minstrel selects ratesthat will give an approximation to the best available through-put, while delivering packets with the highest probability achiev-able given link conditions and a constraint on the transmittertime to be spent on any one packet, so as to be friendly tohigher layer protocols. If Minstrel fails to achieve commu-nication with a neighbour, it collects good evidence that nocommunication is possible. Conversely, if communication isat all possible, Minstrel will find rates to use that will achievethe best reliability and close to the best performance avail-able.},

It is a key component of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. Minstrel is a popular rate adaptation algorithm due to its efficiency and availability in commonly used wireless drivers. However, despite its popularity, little work has been done on evaluating the performance of Minstrel or comparing it to the performance of fixed rates. In this paper, we conduct an experimental study that compares the performance of Minstrel against fixed rates in an IEEE 802.11g testbed. The experiment results show that whilst Minstrel performs reasonably well in static wireless channel conditions, in some cases the algorithm has difficulty selecting the optimal data rate in the presence of dynamic channel conditions. In addition, Minstrel performs well when the channel condition improves from bad quality to good quality. However, Minstrel has trouble selecting the optimal rate when the channel condition deteriorates from good quality to bad quality.},

	abstract = {Today, three different physical (PHY) layers for the IEEE 802.11 WLAN are available (802.11a/b/g); they all provide multi-rate capabilities. To achieve high performance under varying conditions, these devices need to adapt their transmission rate dynamically. While this rate adaptation algorithm is a critical component of their performance, only very few algorithms such as Auto Rate Fallback (ARF) or Receiver Based Auto Rate (RBAR) have been published and the implementation challenges associated with these mechanisms have never been publicly discussed. In this paper, we first present the important characteristics of the 802.11 systems that must be taken into account when such algorithms are designed. Specifically, we emphasize the contrast between low latency and high latency systems, and we give examples of actual chipsets that fall in either of the different categories. We propose an Adaptive ARF (AARF) algorithm for low latency systems that improves upon ARF to provide both short-term and long-term adaptation. The new algorithm has very low complexity while obtaining a performance similar to RBAR, which requires incompatible changes to the 802.11 MAC and PHY protocol. Finally, we present a new rate adaptation algorithm designed for high latency systems that has been implemented and evaluated on an AR5212-based device. Experimentation results show a clear performance improvement over the algorithm previously implemented in the AR5212 driver we used.},

	abstract = {Wireless local area networks (W-LANs) have become increasingly popular due to the recent availability of affordable devices that are capable of communicating at high data rates. These high rates are possible, in part, through new modulation schemes that are optimized for the channel conditions bringing about a dramatic increase in bandwidth efficiency. Since the choice of which modulation scheme to use depends on the current state of the transmission channel, newer wireless devices often support multiple modulation schemes, and hence multiple datarates, with mechanisms to switch between them Users are given the option to either select an operational datarate manually or to let the device automatically choose the appropriate modulation scheme (data rate) to match the prevailing conditions. Automatic rate selection protocols have been studied for cellular networks but there have been relatively few proposals for W-LANs. In this paper we present a rate adaptive MAC protocol called the Receiver-Based AutoRate (RBAR) protocol. The novelty of RBAR is that its rate adaptation mechanism is in the receiver instead of in the sender. This is in contrast to existing schemes in devices like the WaveLAN II [15]. We show that RBAR is better because it results in a more efficient channel quality estimation which is then reflected in a higher overall throughput Our protocol is based on the RTS/CTS mechanism and consequently it can be incorporated into many medium access control protocols including the widely popular IEEE 802.11 protocol. Simulation results of an implementation of RBAR inside IEEE 802.11 show that RBAR performs consistently well.},

	abstract = {The IEEE 802.11 wireless media access standard supports multiple data rates at the physical layer. Moreover, various auto rate adaptation mechanisms at the medium access layer have been proposed to utilize this multi-rate capability by automatically adapting the transmission rate to best match the channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Opportunistic Auto Rate (OAR) protocol to better exploit durations of high-quality channels conditions. The key mechanism of the OAR protocol is to opportunistically send multiple back-to-back data packets whenever the channel quality is good. As channel coherence times typically exceed multiple packet transmission times for both mobile and nonmobile users, OAR achieves signiﬁcant throughput gains as compared to state-of-the-art auto-rate adaptation mechanisms. Moreover, over longer time scales, OAR ensures that all nodes are granted channel access for the same time-shares as achieved by single-rate IEEE 802.11. We describe mechanisms to implement OAR on top of any existing auto-rate adaptation scheme in a nearly IEEE 802.11 compliant manner. We also analytically study OAR and characterize the gains in throughput as a function of the channel conditions. Finally, we perform an extensive set of ns-2 simulations to study the impact of such factors as node velocity, channel conditions, and topology on the throughput of OAR.},

Such dynamic adaptations can improve per-hop performance in wireless networks and therefore increase the network throughput. One of the best and commonly used rate control algorithms is Minstrel implemented in the MadWifi driver in Linux. In this paper we present a comprehensive evaluation of the Minstrel rate control adaptation. We show that network throughput could be further improved if the freshness level of throughput measurements currently used in Minstrel was dynamically adapted to channel conditions. This evaluation of the impact of measurement freshness on transmission rate adaptation was carried out in our platform for controllable and repeatable experiments.},

	abstract = {From version 2.6.22, the mac80211 framework has been incorporated as part of the stock kernel in Linux. This means millions of Linux based devices depend on this framework to provide wireless networking. The framework provides functionalities and interfaces for wireless device drivers (e.g., ath5k) to delegate common tasks to the kernel and to exchange information between physical and upper layers. One of these tasks is rate control at the MAC layer, which uses a metric to evaluate the channel conditions and an algorithm to select a transmission rate that achieves the best performance objective (e.g., max throughput) for the given conditions. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of this framework and its rate control mechanisms does not exist. This paper is the first comprehensive study on rate control mechanisms supported by the mac80211 framework, including overview, evaluation and potential improvements of these mechanisms. In addition to proposing a way to solve the oscillation problem in one of the mechanisms, we propose and evaluate an adaptive and low-cost solution to address collisions due to the hidden terminal problem that has not been considered by both mechanisms. The results show more than 40\% improvement if the proposed solution is used when hidden terminals are present.},

	abstract = {To achieve a real–time behavior in wireless communication systems, the multi–rate support (MRS) provided by the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standard may reveal particularly advantageous. Unfortunately, the most widespread rate adaptation algorithms designed for general purpose applications proved to be unsuitable for the challenging real–time scenario. This has led to the definition of purposely designed algorithms such as RSIN, a rate adaptation technique based on the SNR measurement, which showed very good performance in terms of timeliness and reliability. The goal of this paper is to propose an improvement of RSIN that extends its applicability to a wider range of applications. To this aim, we introduce RSIN–E, an enhanced version of RSIN based on an estimation of the SNR obtained through a learning algorithm. In detail, this paper first provides an exhaustive description of both the proposed learning algorithm and the relevant estimation procedure. Then it presents an extensive performance assessment of RSIN–E carried out via both experimental sessions and simulations. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique and highlight that its performance figures are comparable with those of RSIN, and significantly better than those of Minstrel, a widespread rate adaptation algorithm adopted by most general purpose applications.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICELTICS.2018.8548800},
	abstract = {The rate adaptation algorithm in the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) is used to control the rate for frame transmission. In the Linux kernel, Minstrel-HT is used as the default rate adaptation to control the rate in the IEEE 802.11n/ac WLANs. But if there are frames collisions in the channel caused by the hidden terminal problem, then Minstrel-HT degrade data rate resulting in throughput also become decreased. The use of RTS/CTS transmission mode in Minstrel-HT is based on RTS-Threshold, resulting in throughput also decreasing as transmission overhead increases when there are no collisions in the channel. Previous works have proposed dynamic RTS/CTS activation method but it is only used for legacy WLANs. In this paper, we propose a modified rate control in Minstrel-HT that takes into account the development of PHY and MAC in the IEEE 802.11n/ac WLANs and we call it as Minstrel with Collision Detection for High Throughput (Minstrel-CDHT). The modifications we propose are as follows, if the transmission is not successful, then the first retransmission is done by enabling RTS/CTS mode. If the transmission fails again, it is assumed that the failure is not caused by the collision and the following retransmission is done by disabling RTS/CTS mode. We implement and evaluate this algorithm using NS-3 network simulator. The simulation results show, when the collision occurs in the channel, our proposed algorithm produces higher throughput than the original Minstrel-HT and Minstrel-HT with static RTS/CTS.},

Although the fading effects in a mobile radio system are somewhat different than those in ionospheric and tropospheric channels, the early models are still quite useful to help characterize fading effects in mobile digital communication systems. This tutorial addresses Rayleigh fading primarily in the UHF band. That affects mobile systems such as cellular and personal communication systems (PCS).

In this paper, we design a custom cross-layer framework that enables (i) implementation of multiple and previously unimplemented rate adaptation mechanisms, (ii) experimental evaluation and comparison of rate adaptation protocols on controlled, repeatable channels as well as residential urban and downtown vehicular and non-mobile environments in which we accurately measure channel conditions with 100µs granularity, and (iii) comparison of performance on a per-packet basis with the ideal modulation rate obtained via exhaustive experimental search. Our evaluation reveals that SNR-triggered protocols are susceptible to overselection from the ideal rate when the coherence time is low (a scenario that we show occurs in practice even in a nonmobile topology), and that “in-situ” training can produce large gains to overcome this sensitivity. Another key ﬁnding is that a mechanism eﬀective in diﬀerentiating between collision and fading losses for hidden terminals has severely imbalanced throughput sharing when competing links are even slightly heterogeneous. In general, we ﬁnd trained SNRbased protocols outperform loss-based protocols in terms of the ability to track vehicular clients, accuracy within outdoor environments, and balanced sharing with heterogeneous links (even with physical layer capture).},
