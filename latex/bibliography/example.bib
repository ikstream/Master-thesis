        abstract = {It is increasingly important for network operators to be able to detect the threats that their users
are facing. The DNS (Domain Name System) is a useful tool to do so, as almost every action on
the Internet is preceded by one or more DNS queries. Attackers widely leverage DNS for attacks
such as malware and phishing. Therefore, many threats can be identified by IoCs (Indicator
of Compromise) that reside in DNS queries, such as domain names. However, monitoring DNS
queries is also very privacy invasive. The DNS queries that a user performs give a lot of information
about the user and their behavior. Naively monitoring all DNS queries on the network is therefore
unacceptable from a privacy perspective.
In this thesis, we introduce a threat detection method based on a concept called Bloom filters.
DNS queries can be collected and stored in these Bloom filters, which provide strong privacy
guarantees. For example, we cannot enumerate the queries that are stored, and we can only look
for an exact occurrence in the Bloom filters. Using this threat detection method, we can perform
limited detection of IoCs that reside in the DNS.
We specify goals for the privacy-friendly threat detection method, and identify challenges
and limitations. Then, we design and develop a prototype of the detection method based on
existing software to fulfil the goals. Furthermore, we validate the prototype using three real-world
scenarios. We first look at Booter queries, which can be related to DDoS attacks. Furthermore,
we look at blacklist hits from a spam filtering service. Finally, we test high-quality IoCs from
a security intelligence community in the network. To validate the prototype, we used real-world
DNS queries from the operational recursive name servers at SURFnet, the National Research and
education network in the Netherlands. The results of the validation shows that we can indeed
build a privacy-friendly threat detection method that fulfils the goals we set.
The main contribution of this thesis is a novel, privacy-friendly threat detection method based
on Bloom filters. Furthermore, an open-source prototype is developed and validated, that integrates with all major DNS resolver applications. This thesis aims to provide a starting point for
network operators to get started with the prototype easily.},

        abstract = {Anonymization plays a key role in enabling the public release of network datasets, and yet there are few, if any, techniques for evaluating the efﬁcacy of network data anonymization techniques with respect to the privacy they afford. In fact, recent work suggests that many state-of-the-art anonymization techniques may leak more information than ﬁrst thought. In this paper, we propose techniques for evaluating the anonymity of network data. Speciﬁcally, we simulate the behavior of an adversary whose goal is to deanonymize objects, such as hosts or web pages, within the network data. By doing so, we are able to quantify the anonymity of the data using information theoretic metrics, objectively compare the efﬁcacy of anonymization techniques, and examine the impact of selective deanonymization on the anonymity of the data. Moreover, we provide several concrete applications of our approach on real network data in the hope of underscoring its usefulness to data publishers.},

The data originating from these sensors are in many cases privacyinvasive. Therefore, methods for improving privacy protection for such data is needed. In this paper, we explore if suppression, kanonymity or a combination of them, provides sufficient privacy protection on a published dataset. The results show that the specific dataset only was partly protected in the case of the combination of the two privacy protection methods. The attack vectors used to break the protection includes the sensor deployments, and the physically limitations of the sensors. This indicates, the need to consider how to protect the metadata of sensor deployments as well as the sensor streams. This additional metadata protection can serve as requirements, for anonymization methods for time-series data. However, even with good privacy protection, the building dataset might still be vulnerable to attacks since building data contains repeatable patterns which are susceptible to a range of attacks.},

New location aware applications like e-commerce, web site content and advertisements are just some examples of what has appeared since the last couple of years. Regarding network security, Geolocation also has a significant impact, since it offers possibilities for advanced network security (e.g., including sophisticated geo-based attack correlation/classification). However, determining the physical position of a network entity is challenging, as there is no inherent relationship between an IP address and its geographical location. In addition, with the introduction of IPv6, the address space is enhanced by a factor of 296 making the process far more complex in comparison to IPv4. Although numerous techniques for Geolocation are existing, each strategy is subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, this publication illustrates and evaluates different approaches of Geolocation. Furthermore, strategies to obtain additional information related to the location of IP addresses are examined. After considering procedures how to verify the achieved data and following the ideas of Endo et al., we are designing an architecture for a combination of different methods for optimized Geolocation. Finally we introduce and evaluate our Proof of Concept called geolabel, a tool capable of mapping IPv4 as well as IPv6 addresses to certain geographical locations on a country level.},

        abstract = {Many privacy-enhancing architectures require an anonymous communication channel as a component to acquire tokens or other material from a centralized authority without revealing the requester's identity. While anonymous routing overlays like Tor can provide the required anonymity for TCPlike data streams, it increases dependence on third party infrastructure, and widespread use may overload the Tor network's current capacity. Therefore, we propose to use requests in the Domain Name System as an anonymization layer by forwarding packets over public DNS resolvers operating in recursive mode. In contrast to existing approaches, we focus on UDP datagram transport. As an example use case, we implemented a system for anonymous issuance of blind signatures. We evaluate our domaintailored solution against existing approaches like Tor and analyze its performance and privacy guarantees. Evaluation results show that the achievable data rate using the DNS-based anonymous channel is sufficient for many practical use cases, and that the provided anonymity is comparable to that provided by the Tor network.},

Therefore, it has become an ideal way to conduct online privacy exploitations through the DNS due to people's pervasive usage of the Internet. However, the current DNS doesn't provide any countermeasure against this kind of exploitation, and thus risks severe privacy disclosure problems. In this paper, we give a comprehensive empirical analysis of DNS privacy disclosure problems by exploring potential privacy leaking paths in the DNS. Then we further identify and describe multiple criterions of validity systematically that are obligated when considering DNS privacy preservation. Finally, we propose a simple DNS privacy preserving solution with significant deployment potential in the current DNS, which can only lead to a moderate level of extra query latency perceived by end users.},

From the definition, the privacy problem is to prove that none of the private data can be inferred from the information which is made public. We first analyzed the complete DNS query process now in use; then, from each step of the DNS query process, we discussed the privacy disclosure problem in each step of the query: client side, query transmission process and DNS server side.

        abstract = {Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called k-anonymity has gained popularity. In a k-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k − 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes. In this article, we show using two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called ℓ-diversity that can defend against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for ℓ-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that ℓ-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},

        abstract = {In the presence of security countermeasures, a malware designed for data exfiltration must use a covert channel to achieve its goal. The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is a covert channel commonly used by malware developers today for this purpose. Although the detection of covert channels using the DNS has been studied for the past decade, prior research has largely dealt with a specific subclass of covert channels, namely DNS tunneling. While the importance of tunneling detection should not be minimized, an entire class of low throughput DNS exfiltration malware has been overlooked. In this study, we propose a method for detecting both tunneling and low throughput data exfiltration over the DNS. After determining that previously detected malware used Internet domains that were registered for a cyber-campaign rather than compromising existing legitimate domains, we focus on detecting and denying requests to these domains as an effective data leakage shutdown. Therefore, our proposed solution handles streaming DNS traffic in order to detect and automatically deny requests to domains that are used for data exchange. The initial data collection phase collects DNS logs per domain in a manner that permits scanning for long periods of time, and is thus capable of dealing with “low and slow” attacks. In the second phase features are extracted based on the querying behavior of each domain, and in the last phase an anomaly detection model is used to classify domains based on their use for data exfiltration. With regard to detection, DNS requests to domains that were classified as being used for data exfiltration will be denied indefinitely. Our method was evaluated on a large-scale recursive DNS server’s logs with a peaking high of 47 million requests per hour. Within these DNS logs, we injected data exfiltration traffic from DNS tunneling tools as well as two real-life malware: FrameworkPOS, previously used for the theft of 56M credit cards from Home Depot in 2014, and Backdoor.Win32.Denis, which was active in the Cobalt Kitty APT in 2016. Even when restricting our method to an extremely low false positive rate (i.e., one in fifty thousand domains), it detected all of the above. In addition, the logs are used to compare our system with two recently published methods that focus on detecting DNS tunneling in order to stress the novelty of detecting low throughput exfiltration malware.},

In particular, we are interested in answering the following questions: (1) How is Tor being used? (2) How is Tor being mis-used? (3) Who is using Tor? To sample the results, we show that web traﬃc makes up the majority of the connections and bandwidth, but non-interactive protocols consume a disproportionately large amount of bandwidth when compared to interactive protocols. We provide a survey of how Tor is being misused, both by clients and by Tor router operators. In particular, we develop a method for detecting exit router logging (in certain cases). Finally, we present evidence that Tor is used throughout the world, but router participation is limited to only a few countries.},

In this paper, we describe Herbivore, a peer-to-peer, scalable, tamper-resilient communication system that provides provable anonymity and privacy. Building on dining cryptographer networks, Herbivore scales by partitioning the network into anonymizing cliques. Adversaries able to monitor all network traﬃc cannot deduce the identity of a sender or receiver beyond an anonymizing clique. In addition to strong anonymity, Herbivore simultaneously provides high eﬃciency and scalability, distinguishing it from other anonymous communication protocols. Performance measurements from a prototype implementation show that the system can achieve high bandwidths and low latencies when deployed over the Internet.},

How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k-anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, μ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

of the system beyond the official protocol.  The official protocol parts
include standard queries, responses and the Internet class RR data
formats (e.g., host addresses).  Since the previous RFC set, several
definitions have changed, so some previous definitions are obsolete.

primarily pedagogical.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.},

abstract = {Since the release of the first activity tracker, there has been a steady increase in the number of sensors embedded in wearable devices and with it in the amount and diversity of information that can be derived from these sensors. This development leads to novel privacy threats for users. In a web survey with 248 participants, we explored whether users' willingness to share private data is dependent on how the data is requested by an application. Specifically, requests can be formulated as access to sensor data or as access to information derived from the sensor data (e.g., accelerometer vs. sleep quality). We show that non-expert users lack an understanding of how the two representation levels relate to each other. The results suggest that the willingness to share sensor data over derived information is governed by whether the derived information has positive or negative connotations (e.g., training intensity vs. life expectancy). Using the results of the survey, we derive implications for supporting users in protecting their private data collected via wearable sensors.},

We asked participants to visit a health website, explained OBA to them, and outlined policies governing data collection for OBA purposes. These policies varied by condition. We then asked participants about their willingness to permit the collection of 30 types of information. We identiﬁed classes of information that most participants would not share, as well as classes that nearly half of participants would share. More restrictive data-retention and scope-of-use policies increased participants’ willingness to allow data collection. In contrast, whether the data was collected on a well-known site and whether users could review and modify their data had minimal impact. We discuss public policy implications and improvements to user interfaces to align with users’ privacy preferences.},

the most serious barrier. The consumers and their attitudes and behaviors when using the Internet play an
important role in the discussion about privacy protection. The aim of the current study was to analyze Internet
usage behaviors and users’ willingness to share their data when using digital services and social network sites.
In a two step empirical approach, we first explore users’ perceptions of privacy in the context of Internet usage
and social network sites by means of a focus group approach. In a second step, a quantitative study was carried
out. Using a conjoint measurement approach, user scenarios were created from combinations of different
levels of anonymization extent, data type, and benefits from sharing the data. The respondents’ task was to
decide under which conditions they would be willing to share their data. 80 volunteers (50,6\% women)

This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

        abstract = {Many people are taking a fresh look at IT security strategies in the wake of the NSA revelations. One of the issues that comes up is the need for stronger encryption, using public key cryptography instead of just passwords. This is sometimes referred to as certificate authentication, but certificates are just one of many ways to use public key technology.

One of the core decisions in this field is the key size. Most people have heard that 1024 bit RSA keys have been cracked and are not used any more for web sites or PGP. The next most fashionable number after 1024 appears to be 2048, but a lot of people have also been skipping that and moving to 4096 bit keys. This has lead to some confusion as people try to make decisions about which smartcards to use or which type of CA certificate to use. The discussion here is exclusively about RSA key pairs, although the concepts are similar for other algorithms (although key lengths are not equivalent)},

        abstract = {Storage technology, just like its computing and networking counterparts, has evolved from traditional storage service types, such as block, file, and object. Specifically, the evolution has taken two directions: one along the path of increasing storage media capacity (e.g., tape, Hard Disk Drives, solid-state drives (SSD)) and the other along the architectural front, starting from direct-attached storage (DAS) to the placement of storage resources in networks accessed through various interfaces and protocols to cloud-based storage resource access, which provides a software-based abstraction over all forms of background storage technologies. Accompanying the architectural evolution is the increase in management complexity, which subsequently increases the probability of configuration errors and associated security threats. This document provides an overview of the evolution of the storage technology landscape, current security threats, and the resultant risks. The main focus of this document is to provide a comprehensive set of security recommendations that will address the threats. The recommendations span not only security management areas that are common to an information technology (IT) infrastructure (e.g., physical security, authentication and authorization, change management, configuration control, and incident response and recovery) but also those specific to storage infrastructure (e.g., data protection, isolation, restoration assurance, and encryption).},

        abstract = {Wireless medical sensor networks are becoming very popular in improving the quality of the healthcare systems. Since the data to be handled are very sensitive, the exchange of information over insecure wireless channels can cause serious exposures. The authentication schemes to be employed with sensor networks should be handled with care because of the limited resources and energy available with the sensor nodes. Therefore, this study aims at improving existing authentication schemes by providing protection for healthcare infrastructures against potential, well-known attacks while minimizing the overhead. An anonymous-based user authentication scheme is presented to improve the security features, computation, and communication overhead of the wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme uses improved elliptic curve cryptography and is secure against password guessing attacks and smart card lost/stolen verifier attacks, and also preserves user anonymity. Through the formal and informal security analyses, it is shown that the proposed scheme is secure against possible known attacks, including the password guessing attacks and smart card lost/stolen verifier attacks, and that it also preserves the user anonymity property. In addition, for the formal security verification, the proposed scheme is simulated using the widely accepted automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool. The proposed scheme provides high security along with incurring low computational and communication costs.},

Now, because of the distribution of knowledge, malicious individuals have cleverly learned to take advantage of the loopholes. White hat hackers must constantly stay one step ahead of their black hat counterparts. When all other avenues of password cracking fail, brute force is the only option. Since the advent of secure hashing algorithms, passwords continue to become increasingly more difficult to crack. In this paper, we have presented an algorithm to crack passwords with brute force technique using parallel distribution. It is implemented on an IBM super computer to implement parallel distribution. It is a fact that with a distributed approach, diffusing intense computations across multiple nodes, millions of computations can be processed in a fraction of time.},
