        abstract = {It is increasingly important for network operators to be able to detect the threats that their users
are facing. The DNS (Domain Name System) is a useful tool to do so, as almost every action on
the Internet is preceded by one or more DNS queries. Attackers widely leverage DNS for attacks
such as malware and phishing. Therefore, many threats can be identified by IoCs (Indicator
of Compromise) that reside in DNS queries, such as domain names. However, monitoring DNS
queries is also very privacy invasive. The DNS queries that a user performs give a lot of information
about the user and their behavior. Naively monitoring all DNS queries on the network is therefore
unacceptable from a privacy perspective.
In this thesis, we introduce a threat detection method based on a concept called Bloom filters.
DNS queries can be collected and stored in these Bloom filters, which provide strong privacy
guarantees. For example, we cannot enumerate the queries that are stored, and we can only look
for an exact occurrence in the Bloom filters. Using this threat detection method, we can perform
limited detection of IoCs that reside in the DNS.
We specify goals for the privacy-friendly threat detection method, and identify challenges
and limitations. Then, we design and develop a prototype of the detection method based on
existing software to fulfil the goals. Furthermore, we validate the prototype using three real-world
scenarios. We first look at Booter queries, which can be related to DDoS attacks. Furthermore,
we look at blacklist hits from a spam filtering service. Finally, we test high-quality IoCs from
a security intelligence community in the network. To validate the prototype, we used real-world
DNS queries from the operational recursive name servers at SURFnet, the National Research and
education network in the Netherlands. The results of the validation shows that we can indeed
build a privacy-friendly threat detection method that fulfils the goals we set.
The main contribution of this thesis is a novel, privacy-friendly threat detection method based
on Bloom filters. Furthermore, an open-source prototype is developed and validated, that integrates with all major DNS resolver applications. This thesis aims to provide a starting point for
network operators to get started with the prototype easily.},

        abstract = {Anonymization plays a key role in enabling the public release of network datasets, and yet there are few, if any, techniques for evaluating the efﬁcacy of network data anonymization techniques with respect to the privacy they afford. In fact, recent work suggests that many state-of-the-art anonymization techniques may leak more information than ﬁrst thought. In this paper, we propose techniques for evaluating the anonymity of network data. Speciﬁcally, we simulate the behavior of an adversary whose goal is to deanonymize objects, such as hosts or web pages, within the network data. By doing so, we are able to quantify the anonymity of the data using information theoretic metrics, objectively compare the efﬁcacy of anonymization techniques, and examine the impact of selective deanonymization on the anonymity of the data. Moreover, we provide several concrete applications of our approach on real network data in the hope of underscoring its usefulness to data publishers.},

The data originating from these sensors are in many cases privacyinvasive. Therefore, methods for improving privacy protection for such data is needed. In this paper, we explore if suppression, kanonymity or a combination of them, provides sufficient privacy protection on a published dataset. The results show that the specific dataset only was partly protected in the case of the combination of the two privacy protection methods. The attack vectors used to break the protection includes the sensor deployments, and the physically limitations of the sensors. This indicates, the need to consider how to protect the metadata of sensor deployments as well as the sensor streams. This additional metadata protection can serve as requirements, for anonymization methods for time-series data. However, even with good privacy protection, the building dataset might still be vulnerable to attacks since building data contains repeatable patterns which are susceptible to a range of attacks.},

New location aware applications like e-commerce, web site content and advertisements are just some examples of what has appeared since the last couple of years. Regarding network security, Geolocation also has a significant impact, since it offers possibilities for advanced network security (e.g., including sophisticated geo-based attack correlation/classification). However, determining the physical position of a network entity is challenging, as there is no inherent relationship between an IP address and its geographical location. In addition, with the introduction of IPv6, the address space is enhanced by a factor of 296 making the process far more complex in comparison to IPv4. Although numerous techniques for Geolocation are existing, each strategy is subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, this publication illustrates and evaluates different approaches of Geolocation. Furthermore, strategies to obtain additional information related to the location of IP addresses are examined. After considering procedures how to verify the achieved data and following the ideas of Endo et al., we are designing an architecture for a combination of different methods for optimized Geolocation. Finally we introduce and evaluate our Proof of Concept called geolabel, a tool capable of mapping IPv4 as well as IPv6 addresses to certain geographical locations on a country level.},

        abstract = {Many privacy-enhancing architectures require an anonymous communication channel as a component to acquire tokens or other material from a centralized authority without revealing the requester's identity. While anonymous routing overlays like Tor can provide the required anonymity for TCPlike data streams, it increases dependence on third party infrastructure, and widespread use may overload the Tor network's current capacity. Therefore, we propose to use requests in the Domain Name System as an anonymization layer by forwarding packets over public DNS resolvers operating in recursive mode. In contrast to existing approaches, we focus on UDP datagram transport. As an example use case, we implemented a system for anonymous issuance of blind signatures. We evaluate our domaintailored solution against existing approaches like Tor and analyze its performance and privacy guarantees. Evaluation results show that the achievable data rate using the DNS-based anonymous channel is sufficient for many practical use cases, and that the provided anonymity is comparable to that provided by the Tor network.},

Therefore, it has become an ideal way to conduct online privacy exploitations through the DNS due to people's pervasive usage of the Internet. However, the current DNS doesn't provide any countermeasure against this kind of exploitation, and thus risks severe privacy disclosure problems. In this paper, we give a comprehensive empirical analysis of DNS privacy disclosure problems by exploring potential privacy leaking paths in the DNS. Then we further identify and describe multiple criterions of validity systematically that are obligated when considering DNS privacy preservation. Finally, we propose a simple DNS privacy preserving solution with significant deployment potential in the current DNS, which can only lead to a moderate level of extra query latency perceived by end users.},

From the definition, the privacy problem is to prove that none of the private data can be inferred from the information which is made public. We first analyzed the complete DNS query process now in use; then, from each step of the DNS query process, we discussed the privacy disclosure problem in each step of the query: client side, query transmission process and DNS server side. Finally, we proposed a simple and flexible privacy-preserving query scheme "range query", which could maximally decrease privacy disclosure in the whole DNS query process.

        abstract = {Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called k-anonymity has gained popularity. In a k-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k − 1 other records with respect to certain identifying attributes. In this article, we show using two simple attacks that a k-anonymized dataset has some subtle but severe privacy problems. First, an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. This is a known problem. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that k-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks, and we propose a novel and powerful privacy criterion called ℓ-diversity that can defend against such attacks. In addition to building a formal foundation for ℓ-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that ℓ-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},

        abstract = {In the presence of security countermeasures, a malware designed for data exfiltration must use a covert channel to achieve its goal. The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is a covert channel commonly used by malware developers today for this purpose. Although the detection of covert channels using the DNS has been studied for the past decade, prior research has largely dealt with a specific subclass of covert channels, namely DNS tunneling. While the importance of tunneling detection should not be minimized, an entire class of low throughput DNS exfiltration malware has been overlooked. In this study, we propose a method for detecting both tunneling and low throughput data exfiltration over the DNS. After determining that previously detected malware used Internet domains that were registered for a cyber-campaign rather than compromising existing legitimate domains, we focus on detecting and denying requests to these domains as an effective data leakage shutdown. Therefore, our proposed solution handles streaming DNS traffic in order to detect and automatically deny requests to domains that are used for data exchange. The initial data collection phase collects DNS logs per domain in a manner that permits scanning for long periods of time, and is thus capable of dealing with “low and slow” attacks. In the second phase features are extracted based on the querying behavior of each domain, and in the last phase an anomaly detection model is used to classify domains based on their use for data exfiltration. With regard to detection, DNS requests to domains that were classified as being used for data exfiltration will be denied indefinitely. Our method was evaluated on a large-scale recursive DNS server’s logs with a peaking high of 47 million requests per hour. Within these DNS logs, we injected data exfiltration traffic from DNS tunneling tools as well as two real-life malware: FrameworkPOS, previously used for the theft of 56M credit cards from Home Depot in 2014, and Backdoor.Win32.Denis, which was active in the Cobalt Kitty APT in 2016. Even when restricting our method to an extremely low false positive rate (i.e., one in fifty thousand domains), it detected all of the above. In addition, the logs are used to compare our system with two recently published methods that focus on detecting DNS tunneling in order to stress the novelty of detecting low throughput exfiltration malware.},
